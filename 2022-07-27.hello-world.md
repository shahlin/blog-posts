Hello reader! It's my first blog post ever excluding the Blogger/Blogspot posts that I used to write solely for the purpose of using Google Ads and earning some money back in 2007. If you're wondering how much I made: 0$.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Anyhoo, I'm starting with these blog posts with the thought - _you only really understand a topic well enough when you're able to explain it others_. I would like to explore the tools and technologies out there and have this space to talk about it. Needless to say it's all going to be tech related. Although I won't promise it'll stay that way. And I also won't promise frequent blog posts.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## What do I planning on blogging about?

- Development guides/tutorials
- Opinions
- Commonly faced issues in development
- New findings
- Open source
- And anything I feel like sharing!

&nbsp;

Hoping to keep this practice up! ðŸ˜…
