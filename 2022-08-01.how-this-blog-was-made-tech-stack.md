I like to try out different tech stacks whenever I work on a hobby project. Same goes for this blog, I've tried using a new tool wherever I could. Following is a list of these tools and in general just everything that took to get this blog up and running.

## Statamic CMS (Laravel)
I needed a way to manage content - Blog posts, projects, contributions, etc. During the design phase, I had planned to develop a tiny little custom CMS (Content Management System). But that just seemed like an overkill when there's plenty of battle tested solutions out there.
I wasn't a fan of using Wordpress. Not because it wouldn't fit the requirement but because I've worked with it for quite a while and it still feels pretty old school even with all the new updates.

Enter **[Statamic](https://www.statamic.com)**. Statamic is a [Laravel](https://www.laravel.com) based CMS which _does not require a database to store your content_. It supports file based storage. Since I don't foresee large amounts of records/relationships being created on this blog, it suits well.
It provides a simple control panel right off the bat but that's optional too, I can just create markdown files to create my blog posts without ever logging in to the control panel. There's many neat little features it is packaged with making it a good choice! Just a fun fact, at the time of writing this, I've written less than 50 lines of PHP code and have all of this up and running!

Here's a sample of how the control panel looks like:

## Sass
To start off, I'm not a frontend developer. I love designing but converting the designs into working code, no can do. I needed all the help I could get while developing this site given my CSS skills aren't that great. I had done a quick [HTML5/CSS course on Udemy by Traversy Media](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-html-css-from-the-beginning/). That surely got me up to speed with all the flexbox, grid systems and **[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)**. Last time I did CSS, I still remember using floats for layouts. While Sass didn't eliminate the need to know CSS, it surely made some things easier with features like nesting, variables, loops, etc

## DigitalOcean
After the blog finished its initial stages of development, it had to be hosted somewhere. Usually, I'd just go with a basic [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) + [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) setup. Given Statamic's file based storage, I didn't need a dedicated database service so I could do with just an EC2 instance. But that's just doing what I always do (and incur unnecessary costs along the way), which is why I decided to give [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) a try. Just a basic $5 droplet and everything just works. Of course it took a bit of time to set up everything - latest version of PHP, SSL certificate, ZSH, Nginx, folder permissions, etc - but that's just a one time setup effort.

## Laravel Sail

For local development, I've had a bit of trouble initially since I have 2 accounts on my Mac - Personal and Work. Work has PHP 7.3 in use and Personal requires PHP 8.1. I've tried using [Valet's](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/valet) new multi-version support but wasn't successful and with all the brew installation troubles I faced, it just made it harder. To solve this issue, I decided to use Docker. Laravel comes with it's own command line interface for working with Docker - [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail). The only tiny task I still have to do is stop Valet from running before I start up the Docker container.

## Github Actions
The blog's repo is currently private on Github (might make it public someday). I needed to setup some level of CI/CD on this blog just to be able to deploy quicker. I decided to give [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) a try. I have a simple deployment script which connects to the Ubuntu instance and runs another deployment script. This deployment script:
- Brings the site down with Laravel's down command
- Pulls latest repository updates
- Installs any dependencies
- Clears cache
- Compiles frontend assets (npm)
- Brings the site back up!
